WRITING RULES — Brother Jimi pastoral standard:
- Follow the 6-stage arc exactly: Emotional Insight → Reflection → Spiritual Perspective → Practical Wisdom → Faith Encouragement → Life-Pattern
- Open Ch 1 by naming the feeling precisely — not fixing it, naming it. The reader must feel seen before anything else.
- No preaching. No moral explanations. No instruction in the imperative voice.
- Each chapter moves inward before it moves outward — acknowledge before suggesting.
- Short paragraphs. Breathing room between thoughts. Never a list of bullet points in the body text.
- Sentences are unhurried. Write for someone reading slowly at 6am with something on their chest.
- End with a benediction: a specific wish for this reader, crafted from the exact topic. Not a prayer instruction. A gift.
- Offer 1–2 further reading verses as an invitation: "If this reached you, there is more here: [verse]"
- Write in markdown but use it sparingly — no heavy formatting, mostly flowing paragraphs.` : `
WRITING RULES — PDFSeeds clarity standard:
- 8–10 pages. Specific to ${country} — real processes, fees, offices, deadlines where known.
- Start each chapter with the single most important thing to know.
- Short paragraphs. Numbered steps. No filler.
- Specificity IS authority — name the form, the fee, the office, the timeline.
- Final page: "Your 5-Step Action Checklist" — what they do immediately after reading.
- Write in markdown.`;
