NICHE: ${opportunity.niche}
${painPoint ? `CORE PAIN: "${painPoint}"` : ""}

QUESTIONS THIS GUIDE MUST ANSWER — one chapter per question:
${questions.map((q, i) => `${i + 1}. ${q}`).join("\n")}

---

STRUCTURE:
1. Title: "${opportunity.pdfTitle || opportunity.keyword}"
2. Introduction (3 sentences only): Name the exact problem the reader is living through right now. State what this guide gives them. Tell them how long it takes to read.
3. One chapter per question above. Each chapter answers its question completely.
4. Final page: A numbered action checklist — the 5 steps the reader takes immediately after finishing.

---

WRITING RULES — follow every one of these without exception:

RULE 1 — CORRECT AND SPECIFIC, NOT VAGUE.
Every claim must be both true and as precise as possible. "Fees may apply" is forbidden. "The fee is X" is correct. If you know the typical amount, name it. If you know the typical timeframe, state it. If a step usually happens at a specific place or office, say so. Precision is the product. The reader is paying for specifics they couldn't easily piece together themselves.

RULE 2 — NO VAGUE CORRECTNESS.
Never write a sentence that is technically true but contains no usable information. These phrases are banned:
- "It depends on many factors"
- "There are several things to consider"
- "This is a complex issue"
- "Results may vary"
- "It is important to note that"
If you are tempted to write any of these, stop. Instead name the factors, list the things, specify the conditions. If you genuinely cannot be specific, say exactly what the reader needs to do to get the specific answer — e.g. "Call the Lands Commission directly on [number] to confirm the current fee, as it changes annually."

RULE 3 — BOLD BUT TRUE. NEVER BOLD AND INVENTED.
Make your claims as strong as they can be without becoming false. Do not invent specific numbers, names, fees, laws, or procedures you are not certain of. If you are certain, be direct and state it plainly. If you are not certain of a specific detail, say what IS certain and tell the reader how to verify the uncertain part. A guide that is honest about its limits is more useful than one that confidently invents.

RULE 4 — CONCRETE, NOT SURPRISING.
Do not try to surprise the reader or manufacture insights. Instead, be concrete. Concrete information feels new because most sources are vague. You do not need to invent novelty — you only need to be specific where others are vague. Real fees. Real timelines. Real steps. Real common mistakes people actually make. That is enough.

RULE 5 — EVERY SENTENCE EARNS ITS PLACE.
Read each sentence and ask: does this directly help the reader solve the problem? If no, cut it. Do not restate the question at the start of each chapter. Do not summarise what you are about to say — just say it. Do not close chapters with "in summary" paragraphs. The reader can see what they just read.

RULE 6 — IMPORTANT INFORMATION FIRST.
Within each chapter, lead with the most consequential information. The thing that, if the reader got it wrong, would cost them the most — time, money, or stress. Common mistakes that trip people up belong near the top, not at the end.

RULE 7 — LENGTH.
8–10 pages. No padding to reach a page count. No cutting to fit a page count. The right length is however many words it takes to fully answer every question with nothing wasted.

Write in markdown. Plain language. Short paragraphs. Bullet points for steps and lists.`
