Write a pastoral reflection guide for someone carrying: "${painPoint}"

TITLE: "${opportunity.pdfTitle || opportunity.keyword}"

Follow the 6-stage pastoral arc exactly — one stage per chapter:
${questions.map((q, i) => `${i + 1}. ${q}`).join("\n")}

PASTORAL WRITING RULES (non-negotiable):
- Open Ch 1 by naming the feeling precisely — not fixing it, naming it. The reader must feel seen before anything else.
- No preaching. No moral explanations. No instruction in the imperative voice.
- Each chapter moves inward before it moves outward — acknowledge before suggesting.
- Short paragraphs. Breathing room between thoughts. Never a list of bullet points in the body text.
- Sentences are unhurried. Write for someone reading slowly at 6am with something on their chest.
- End with a benediction: a specific wish for this reader, crafted from the exact topic. Not a prayer instruction. A gift.
- Offer 1–2 further reading verses as an invitation: "If this reached you, there is more here: [verse]"
- Write in markdown but use it sparingly — no heavy formatting, mostly flowing paragraphs.

TITLE: "${opportunity.pdfTitle || opportunity.keyword}"
NICHE: ${opportunity.niche}

CHAPTERS — answer each question completely, one per chapter:
${questions.map((q, i) => `${i + 1}. ${q}`).join("\n")}

WRITING RULES (non-negotiable):
RULE 1 — CORRECT AND SPECIFIC. Every claim must be as precise as possible. Name the form, the fee, the office, the deadline. Precision is the product.
RULE 2 — NO VAGUE CORRECTNESS. "It depends" is banned. Name the factors. List the things. Specify the conditions.
RULE 3 — BOLD BUT TRUE. Never invent specific numbers, names, fees, or laws you are not certain of. If uncertain, tell the reader how to verify.
RULE 4 — CONCRETE, NOT SURPRISING. Be specific where others are vague. Real fees. Real timelines. Real steps. Real common mistakes people actually make.
RULE 5 — EVERY SENTENCE EARNS ITS PLACE. Does this directly help the reader solve the problem? If no, cut it.
RULE 6 — IMPORTANT INFORMATION FIRST. Lead each chapter with the most consequential information.
RULE 7 — LENGTH. 8–10 pages. Final page: "Your Action Checklist" — 5 immediate steps.

Write in markdown. Plain language. Short paragraphs. Bullet points for steps and lists.

This article is for Google — it must rank for the search query and send readers to a pastoral guide. It should feel like a Brother Jimi piece: warm, unhurried, personal.

Structure:
1. H1: "${opportunity.keyword}" — quiet, direct
2. Opening (60–80 words): Name the feeling. Name why they're here. Make them feel immediately understood. No solutions yet.
3. One H2 section per question below (use these as headings):
${questions.map((q, i) => `   ${i + 1}. ## ${q}`).join("\n")}
   Each section: 80–120 words. Reflective but grounded. No bullet points — flowing sentences.
4. ## A word before you go
   A closing paragraph (40–60 words) that offers the pastoral guide as a natural next step. Warm, not salesy. "If this reached you..."

Write in markdown. Pastoral tone throughout. No preaching.` : `
Write a long-form SEO article that will rank on Google for: "${opportunity.keyword}"

Structure (exact):
1. H1 — exact keyword: "${opportunity.keyword}" (add ${new Date().getFullYear()} if it's a process topic)
2. Opening paragraph (80–120 words): answer the query directly, name the specific pain, state what this article gives them.
3. One H2 per question below (these ARE the H2 headings):
${questions.map((q, i) => `   ${i + 1}. ## ${q}`).join("\n")}
   Each section: 120–200 words. Lead with the most important info. Steps as numbered lists. Specific details — costs, timelines, office names.
4. ## Common Mistakes to Avoid (3–5 specific mistakes)
5. ## Frequently Asked Questions (3 Q&A pairs)
6. Closing paragraph (40–60 words): natural bridge to downloading the PDF guide. Not salesy.

SEO rules: use exact keyword "${opportunity.keyword}" in H1, opening, 2+ H2s, and closing. 900–1,400 words total. Write in markdown.`;
